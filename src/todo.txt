#iritate through the tree, taking the root and an input file (file directly after the < symbol) as  parameters and 
then go to the left child and execute the command  and update the output variable, and then go back to the root, then 
go to the right child then update the input to be the output of the pipe, and then repeat the same process using recursion.

#there are errors and memory leaks in the ftlexer()
#Use the libft functions(library)

#in functions get_filein() and get_fileout() make the files and operators(< >) null
Then edit the execution functions (child_process and exec_command) so that they take the
first input file the value returned from get_filein(), and so for the output.
