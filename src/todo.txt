first input file the value returned from get_filein(), and so for the output.

#THE difference between the append and heredoc is that in the append the get_filein()
returns NULL, this is how to differiniate between the append and heredoc

#Handle the $ symbol in the following cases : echo $ and  << $ >> output.txt
